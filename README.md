# Business Demand Overview and User Stories
Demand analysis is the research conducted by companies that aim at understanding customer demand for a certain product. Businesses generally use it to determine whether they can successfully enter the market and obtain the expected profit. During this process, the management decides on cost allocation, production, advertising, pricing, etc.

**Evaluating customers' response towards a product-**
Gaining and monitoring customer feedback is vital if your goal is to see customers' reactions to your new product. This is a great way to find out whether consumers are satisfied with your goods or if there's still something you can improve.

**Formulating a pricing policy-**

Understanding the trend of consumer demand allows you to quickly decide whether to increase or decrease the price for a particular product. Remember, companies can't set prices without understanding the inclinations of their target audience.
