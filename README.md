# Business Demand Overview and User Stories
Demand analysis is the research conducted by companies that aim at understanding customer demand for a certain product. Businesses generally use it to determine whether they can successfully enter the market and obtain the expected profit. During this process, the management decides on cost allocation, production, advertising, pricing, etc.

**Evaluating customers' response towards a product-**
Gaining and monitoring customer feedback is vital if your goal is to see customers' reactions to your new product. This is a great way to find out whether consumers are satisfied with your goods or if there's still something you can improve.

**Formulating a pricing policy-**
You can set the prices after having analy zed the demand thoroughly. Understanding the trend of consumer demand allows you to quickly decide whether to increase or decrease the price for a particular product. Remember, companies can't set prices without understanding the inclinations of their target audience.

**Sales forecasting-**
It enables you to make informed business decisions and predict your company's performance. With a detailed analysis, you can estimate your future sales. Sales forecasting can give you insights and tips on managing your firm's cash flow, resources, and workforce. Besides the proper allocation of resources, it helps you predict sales revenue.

**Establishing a production policy-** 
It enables you to define the gap between demand and supply. You can estimate the necessary number of raw materials to maintain the regular supply. Besides, your company can utilize resources to the maximum if your operations are based on forecasts.

They help us in creating good dashboards as we can see what all criteria we need to fulfill the acceptance criteria that was asked by the sales manager.

# Fact Table
In data warehousing, a Fact Table is one that contains the measurements, metrics, or facts of a business operation. It is surrounded by Dimension Tables and is found at the core of a star or snowflake schema.

When several fact tables are utilized, a "fact constellation schema" is used to organize them.

There are two sorts of columns in a fact table: those that hold facts and those that serve as a foreign key to dimension tables.

A fact table's main key is generally a composite key made up of all of the table's foreign keys.

Fact tables hold several sorts of measurements such as additive, non-additive, and partly additive measures and include the data warehouse's information.

Fact tables are used to evaluate dimensional qualities because they give additive values that behave as independent variables.

# Dimension Table
Dimension Tables contain the descriptions of the objects in a fact table. They aid in the description of dimensions such as dimension values, characteristics, and keys.

Dimension Tables are usually of modest size. The number of rows might range from a few hundreds to thousands.

The term "dimension table" refers to a collection or set of data pertaining to any quantifiable occurrence. They serve as the foundation for dimensional modeling.

Dimension Tables include a column that serves as a primary key, allowing each dimension row or record to be uniquely identified. Through this key, it is linked to the fact tables. When it's made, a system-generated key called a surrogate key is used to uniquely identify the rows in the dimension.
